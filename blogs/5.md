# Anthropic Argument for Continuous Subjective Experience

**Written by Soroush Saberan**

## The Initial Probabilistic Dilemma

Let us assume, for the sake of argument, the existence of an afterlife. We can then define two distinct periods of conscious existence:

1.  **$\text{Life}_1$**: The current, finite period of conscious existence, approximated as roughly 100 years.
2.  **$\text{Life}_2$**: A hypothetical subsequent period, assumed for this dilemma to be infinite or indefinitely long.

If one were to randomly select a moment from the entirety of an individual's conscious existence spanning only these two assumed periods ($\text{Life}_1$ and $\text{Life}_2$), the probability of that moment falling within $\text{Life}_1$ is vanishingly small if $\text{Life}_2$ is infinite.

Let $T_{\text{Life}_1}$ be the duration of the current conscious existence, and $T_{\text{Life}_2}$ be the duration of the hypothetical subsequent conscious existence.

The total duration of conscious existence considered in this specific scenario is $T_{\text{Total}} = T_{\text{Life}_1} + T_{\text{Life}_2}$.

If $T_{\text{Life}_2} \rightarrow \infty$, then the probability $P(\text{moment is in } \text{Life}_1) = \frac{T_{\text{Life}_1}}{T_{\text{Life}_1} + T_{\text{Life}_2}} \rightarrow 0$.

However, our current subjective experience is situated in what we perceive as $\text{Life}_1$. This presents a stark improbability under the initial assumption of an infinite $\text{Life}_2$ that directly follows $\text{Life}_1$ with preserved memory and identity. This observation suggests that the existence of such an infinite and directly remembered $\text{Life}_2$ is unlikely.

## The Exception: Unrecognized Continuation

An alternative interpretation arises if our current experience ($\text{Life}_1$) _is actually_ a subsequent period of conscious existence (i.e., it's technically some $\text{Life}_i$ where $i > 1$) but we are unaware of this fact because memory is not preserved across the transition from the preceding state ($\text{Life}_{i-1}$). If memory and the capacity for subjective experience (sentience) are distinct mechanisms, then the cessation of a previous biological life and its associated memory functions would not necessarily entail the cessation of sentience. The "self" experiencing the current life would not recall any previous lives.

## The Anthropic Perspective on Time and Sentience

**The Second Probabilistic Dilemma**: What are the chances that time just so happens to be where it needs to be for you to be alive right now? If we assume you only have 1 life, then this single, finite period of existence becomes an extraordinarily improbable event when viewed against the backdrop of an infinite timeline.

Let $T_{\text{Life}_1}$ denote the duration of your current, finite period of conscious existence (as defined earlier, approximated as roughly 100 years). For this specific dilemma, we assume this $\text{Life}_1$ is the _only_ period of conscious existence you will ever have. Let $T_{\text{Timeline}}$ represent the total duration of an infinite timeline, such that $T_{\text{Timeline}} \rightarrow \infty$.

If one were to randomly select a moment from the entirety of this infinite $T_{\text{Timeline}}$, the probability of that moment falling within your unique $T_{\text{Life}_1}$ is:

$P(\text{moment is in } \text{Life}_1) = \lim_{T_{\text{Timeline}} \rightarrow \infty} \frac{T_{\text{Life}_1}}{T_{\text{Timeline}}} = 0$.

This indicates that if an individual has only one finite period of conscious existence (with duration $T_{\text{Life}_1}$) throughout an infinite timeline, the probability of that existence coinciding with the present moment (or any specific, predetermined finite interval) is vanishingly small.

However, subjective experience can only be registered during periods of sentience. From the perspective of the sentient entity, periods of non-sentience are subjectively non-existent. If sentience ceases after $\text{Life}_1$ and then, after an arbitrarily long period or in a different universe, reignites as a new period of sentience ($\text{Life}_2$ or more generally $\text{Life}_{i+1}$ follows $\text{Life}_i$), the subjective experience would be one of continuous awareness. The intervening duration, devoid of sentience, would not be perceived as a passage of time by the experiencing subject.

## Conclusion: Continuous Sentience, Discontinuous Memory

Based on this line of anthropic reasoning:

1.  The extreme improbability of experiencing a finite $\text{Life}_1$ if an infinite $\text{Life}_2$ (with preserved memory of $\text{Life}_1$) exists, casts doubt on the traditional concept of an afterlife where identity and memory seamlessly carry over.
2.  The paradox of experiencing _this particular moment_ ($\text{Life}_1$) in an infinite timeline is resolved if sentience itself is the constant from the subjective viewpoint. We can only observe time when we are sentient.
3.  Therefore, the resolution to these dilemmas suggests that while memory (as a biological or otherwise localized phenomenon associated with a specific $\text{Life}_i$) may be finite and terminate with the end of that $\text{Life}_i$, sentience or subjective experience itself may be continuous. The subjective "now" is always experienced, regardless of the objective temporal gaps between periods of embodied consciousness (different $\text{Life}_i$ segments), because those gaps are, by definition, not experienced. This implies a form of continuous subjective experience, even if specific memories and identities associated with each $\text{Life}_i$ are transient.

Or put more simply:

- $\text{Life}_1 \rightarrow \text{Life}_2$ where $T_{\text{Life}_2} \rightarrow \infty$ (with preserved memory and identity from $\text{Life}_1$) fails due to probabilistic dilemma 1.
- $\text{nothing} \rightarrow \text{Life}_1 \rightarrow \text{nothing}$ (where $\text{Life}_1$ is a single, isolated period of sentience in an infinite timeline) fails due to probabilistic dilemma 2.
- $\ldots \rightarrow \text{Life}_{i} \rightarrow \text{Life}_{i+1} \rightarrow \text{Life}_{i+2} \rightarrow \ldots$ where each $\text{Life}_{i}$ is a finite duration (and memory is not preserved between these lives), resolves both dilemma 1 (since dilemma 1 implies infinite memory cannot exist) and dilemma 2 (since dilemma 2 implies infinite sentience must exist). Our current experience is simply one such $\text{Life}_i$.

## Important Caveat

My reasoning makes some assumptions, the main ones being that consciousness is something that is measurable, and that individuals can have separate and distinct consciousnesses. If someone could find a measurable difference between conscious vs not conscious, or if someone could prove that such a thing cannot be measured, then that would significantly affect this argument. If it were proven that consciousness cannot be measured, then my argument falls apart. And if a way to measure consciousness distinctly from other conscious and non-conscious things were to be found, then that would add support to my argument, since it would provide an empirical basis for defining and quantifying the periods of sentience ($T_{\text{Life}_i}$, potential subsequent periods of sentience even if subjectively experienced as continuous) and non-sentience. This measurability and distinctness would allow the durations $T_{\text{Life}_1}$, $T_{\text{Life}_2}$, or any other segment of conscious experience ($T_{\text{Life}_i}$) for an individual to be treated as operationally definable quantities, making the probabilistic analysis more concrete and less purely conceptual. Furthermore, identifying distinct individual consciousnesses would be crucial for the premise that it is _your_ specific, individual stream of subjective experience that is undergoing these transitions and continuities, which is fundamental to the anthropic problem (i.e., why _this_ $\text{Life}_i$ for _this_ particular consciousness).
