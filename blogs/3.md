Below is the first chapter from a book I wrote. It introduces essential math and proof techniques that are necessary to know before diving into learning almost any branch of math. It is written in such a way that no prerequisite knowledge is needed.

# Chapter 1: Preliminaries

## 1.1 Review of Set Theory

## Basic Sets

Set theory is a fundamental branch of mathematics that studies sets, which are collections of unique objects. The concept of sets is one of the most basic notions in mathematics.

### Finite Sets

We can describe a finite collection of unique objects using a finite set. For example, we can describe the set of planets in our solar system as:

$$
\{mercury, venus, earth, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune\}
$$

Since all objects in a set are unique:

$$
\{mercury, mercury, venus, venus, earth, earth\} = \{mercury, venus, earth\}
$$

### Infinite Sets

We can describe an infinite collection of unique objects using an infinite set. Just like for finite sets, all objects in an infinite set are unique.

### The Set of Natural Numbers ($\mathbb{N}$)

The set of Natural Numbers, denoted by $\mathbb{N}$, is the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots\}$.

### The Set of Integers ($\mathbb{Z}$)

The set of Integers, denoted by $\mathbb{Z}$, includes all natural numbers, their negatives, and zero. That is, $\mathbb{Z}$ is the set $\{\dots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots\}$.

### Example:

-8 and 0 are integers. They're included in the set $\mathbb{Z}$, but not in the set $\mathbb{N}$.

### The Set of Rational Numbers ($\mathbb{Q}$)

Rational Numbers, represented by $\mathbb{Q}$, are any numbers that can be expressed as a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $b \neq 0$. This set includes all integers (since an integer can be represented as a fraction with denominator 1), as well as fractions and decimal numbers that can be expressed as a fraction.

### Example:

$\frac{2}{3}$, 0.75 (which can be expressed as $\frac{3}{4}$), and -7 (which can be expressed as $\frac{-7}{1}$) are all members of the set $\mathbb{Q}$.

### The Set of Real Numbers ($\mathbb{R}$)

The set of Real Numbers, denoted by $\mathbb{R}$, is the set of all numbers that can be represented on a number line. This includes rational numbers, as well as irrational numbers (numbers that cannot be expressed as a fraction of integers, such as $\sqrt{2}$ or $\pi$).

### Example:

$\pi$, $2$, and $-\sqrt{3}$ are all members of the set $\mathbb{R}$.

### The Set of Complex Numbers ($\mathbb{C}$)

The set of Complex Numbers, denoted by $\mathbb{C}$ is the set of all numbers of the form $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit with the property that $i^2 = -1$.

### Example:

$3 + 2i$, $7$, and $-i$ are all members of the set $\mathbb{C}$. Notice that all real numbers are also complex numbers (with an imaginary part of \(0\)).

### The Empty Set

The empty set, denoted $\emptyset$, is the set containing no elements.

### Constructing a Set

We can construct a set using set builder notation. The general form of set builder notation is:

$$
\{ \text{expression} \mid \text{condition or predicate} \}
$$

The vertical bar (or sometimes a colon) can be read as "such that".

### Example:

The set $\{x^2 \mid x \in \mathbb{N}\}$ reads as "The set of all elements $x^2$ such that $x$ is an element of $\mathbb{N}$".

### Practice Problems

1. Determine whether the number $\sqrt{8}$ is a member of $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$, or $\mathbb{C}$. Justify your answers.

2. If $x$ and $y$ are members of $\mathbb{N}$ and $x < y$, can the number $\frac{x}{y}$ be a member of $\mathbb{N}$? What if $x > y$? Justify your answers.

3. Provide an example of a number that is a member of $\mathbb{C}$ but not a member of $\mathbb{R}$.

4. True or False: All members of $\mathbb{Q}$ are also members of $\mathbb{Z}$. Justify your answer.

5. Provide an example of a number that is a member of $\mathbb{R}$ but not a member of $\mathbb{Q}$.

6. Translate the following into English: $\{ x + y \mid x \in \mathbb{N}, y = 2x \}$

## Basic Set Operations

In this section, we will discuss some of the basic operations performed on sets.

### Union

The union of two sets $A$ and $B$ (denoted as $A \cup B$) is the set containing all the elements of $A$ and $B$.

For example, if $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{2, 3, 4\}$, then $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$.

### Intersection

The intersection of two sets $A$ and $B$ (denoted as $A \cap B$) is the set containing all the common elements of $A$ and $B$.

For example, if $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{2, 3, 4\}$, then $A \cap B = \{2, 3\}$.

### Difference

The difference of two sets $A$ and $B$ (denoted as $A - B$) is the set of elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$.

For example, if $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{2, 3, 4\}$, then $A - B = \{1\}$.

### Complement

The complement of a set $A$ with respect to a universal set $U$ (denoted as $A'$ or $A^c$) is the set of all elements in $U$ that are not in $A$.

For example, if $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, then $A' = \{4\}$.

### Subset

A set $A$ is a subset of a set $B$ (denoted as $A \subseteq B$) if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.

For example, if $A = \{1, 2\}$ and $B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, then $A$ is a subset of $B$.

### Power set

The power set of a set $A$ (denoted as $\mathcal{P}(A)$) is the set of all subsets of $A$.

For example, if $A = \{1, 2\}$, then $\mathcal{P}(A) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1, 2\}\}$.

### Cartesian Product

The Cartesian product of two sets $A$ and $B$ (denoted by $A \times B$) is the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$.

Formally, $A \times B = \{(a, b) | a \in A , \text{and} , b \in B\}$.

For example, if $A = \{1, 2\}$ and $B = \{3, 4\}$, then the Cartesian product $A \times B = \{(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)\}$.

The concept of Cartesian product can be extended to more than two sets. For instance, the Cartesian product of three sets $A$, $B$, and $C$ would be a set of ordered triples, i.e., $A \times B \times C = \{(a, b, c) | a \in A, b \in B, c \in C\}$.

The Cartesian product is used extensively in many areas of mathematics including geometry (as in the Cartesian coordinate system) and in defining relations and functions.

### Practice Problems

1. Let $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$, $B = \{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$, and $C = \{7, 8, 9, 10\}$. Compute $(A \cup B) \cap C$ and $A \cup (B \cap C)$. Are they equal?

2. Given $U = \{1, 2, 3, ..., 10\}$ and $A = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\}$, find the complement of $A$ with respect to $U$ and calculate the union of $A$ and its complement.

3. Given the sets $P = \{a, b, c\}$ and $Q = \{1, 2, 3\}$. List out the elements in the Cartesian product $P \times Q$.

4. Compute the power set of the set $B = \{x, y, z\}$.

5. Assume we have a universal set $U = \{a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j\}$ and we have subsets $A = \{a, b, c, d\}$, $B = \{e, f, g, h\}$, and $C = \{i, j\}$. If $D = (A \cup B)'$, compute $D \cap C$.

6. Given $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$, $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$, and $C = \{5, 6, 7\}$, find $(A \cup B) - C$.

7. Let $A = \{1, 2\}$, $B = \{3, 4\}$, and $C = \{5, 6\}$. Compute the Cartesian product $A \times B \times C$.

## Relations and Functions

A relation $R$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is a set of ordered pairs $(a, b)$, where $a$ is in $A$ and $b$ is in $B$. This can be written as $R \subseteq A \times B$. For example, if $A = \{1, 2\}$ and $B = \{3, 4\}$, a relation from $A$ to $B$ might be $\{(1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)\}$.

A function $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is a special kind of relation such that each element of $A$ is related to exactly one element of $B$. This can be written as $f: A \rightarrow B$.

For example, let's consider a function $f: A \rightarrow B$ where $A = \{1, 2\}$ and $B = \{3, 4\}$. One possible function could be defined as $f(1) = 3$ and $f(2) = 4$, or $\{(1, 3), (2, 4)\}$.

### Domain and Codomain

The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (the set $A$ in our function definition), while the codomain is the set of all possible output values (the set $B$ in our function definition).

In our previous example, the domain is $A = \{1, 2\}$ and the codomain is $B = \{3, 4\}$.

### Injection (One-to-One Function)

A function $f: A \rightarrow B$ is an injection if every element in $B$ is the image of at most one element in $A$. This means that if $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$, then $a_1 = a_2$.

For instance, let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{4, 5, 6, 7\}$. The function $f: A \rightarrow B$ where $f(1) = 4$, $f(2) = 5$, and $f(3) = 6$ is an injection because each element in $A$ is mapped to a distinct element in $B$.

### Surjection (Onto Function)

A function $f: A \rightarrow B$ is a surjection if every element in $B$ is the image of at least one element in $A$. This means that for every $b$ in $B$, there is at least one $a$ in $A$ such that $f(a) = b$.

For instance, consider $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{4, 5\}$. The function $f: A \rightarrow B$ where $f(1) = 4$ and $f(2) = 5$ is a surjection because every element in $B$ is mapped by at least one element in $A$.

### Bijection (One-to-One Correspondence)

A function $f: A \rightarrow B$ is a bijection if it is both an injection and a surjection. This means that each element in $B$ corresponds to exactly one element in $A$, and vice versa.

For instance, consider $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{4, 5, 6\}$. The function $f: A \rightarrow B$ where $f(1) = 4$, $f(2) = 5$, $f(3) = 6$ is a bijection because it is both an injection and a surjection.

### Function Composition

Function composition is an operation that takes two functions and produces another function. If we have two functions $f: A \rightarrow B$ and $g: B \rightarrow C$, then the composition of $g$ and $f$, denoted as $g \circ f$, is a function from $A$ to $C$.

The composition $g \circ f$ is defined as $(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))$ for all $x$ in $A$. That is, to compute the value of $g \circ f$ at a point $x$, first apply the function $f$ to $x$, and then apply the function $g$ to the result.

Note that the function $f$ is applied first and the function $g$ second, even though the notation $g \circ f$ might suggest the opposite. Remember, the input to $g$ must be in the set $B$, so $f$ must be applied first to transform $x$ from $A$ to $B$.

### Example of Function Composition

Let's consider an example. Let $A = \{1, 2\}$, $B = \{3, 4\}$, and $C = \{5, 6\}$.

Let $f: A \rightarrow B$ and $g: B \rightarrow C$ be defined as $f(1) = 3$, $f(2) = 4$, $g(3) = 5$ and $g(4) = 6$.

Then the composition of $g$ and $f$ is a function from $A$ to $C$ defined by $(g \circ f)(1) = g(f(1)) = g(3) = 5$ and $(g \circ f)(2) = g(f(2)) = g(4) = 6$.

### Properties of Function Composition

Function composition is associative. This means that if you have three functions $f: A \rightarrow B$, $g: B \rightarrow C$, and $h: C \rightarrow D$, then $(h \circ g) \circ f = h \circ (g \circ f)$. Proof:

$((f \circ g) \circ h)(x) = (f \circ g) \circ h(x) = f \circ g(h(x)) = f(g(h(x)))$

$(f \circ (g \circ h))(x) = f \circ (g \circ h)(x) = f \circ g(h(x)) = f(g(h(x)))$

Therefore, $((f \circ g) \circ h)(x) = (f \circ (g \circ h))(x)$.

However, function composition is not generally commutative. This means that $g \circ f$ is not always the same as $f \circ g$. The functions $f$ and $g$ must have special properties for these two compositions to be equal. This is because the domain and codomain of each function matters. For $g \circ f$ to be defined, the codomain of $f$ must be the same as or included in the domain of $g$ and vice versa for $f \circ g$.

### Practice Problems

1. If $A = \{x, y, z\}$ and $B = \{1, 2\}$, give an example of a function from $A$ to $B$ that is not an injection.

2. If $A = \{x, y, z\}$ and $B = \{1, 2\}$, give an example of a function from $A$ to $B$ that is not a surjection.

3. If $A = \{a, b\}$ and $B = \{1, 2\}$, give an example of a function from $A$ to $B$ that is a bijection.

4. True or False: Every bijection has an inverse that is also a bijection. (Given $f(a) = b$, the inverse of $f$, denoted $f^{-1}$, always has the property $f^{-1}(b) = a$)

5. True or False: If a function $f: A \rightarrow B$ has a domain of 5 elements and a codomain of 3 elements, the function cannot be a bijection.

6. Consider three sets $A = \{1, 2\}$, $B = \{3, 4\}$, and $C = \{5, 6\}$. We define three functions $f: A \rightarrow B$, $g: B \rightarrow C$, and $h: C \rightarrow A$ as follows:

   $f$ is defined by $f(1) = 3$ and $f(2) = 4$.

   $g$ is defined by $g(3) = 5$ and $g(4) = 6$.

   $h$ is defined by $h(5) = 1$ and $h(6) = 2$.

   Determine if the function $h \circ g \circ f: A \rightarrow A$ is bijective.

## Cardinality

Cardinality is a measure that tells us the number of elements in a set, and it serves as a bridge connecting set theory to other branches of mathematics such as arithmetic and algebra. This concept allows us to compare the "sizes" of both finite and infinite sets.

### Finite Sets

The cardinality of a finite set is simply the number of elements in the set. For example, the set $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ has a cardinality of 5, often denoted as $|A| = 5$.

### Infinite Sets

When we deal with infinite sets, the concept of cardinality becomes more intriguing. There are different "sizes" of infinity! These sizes are differentiated using a concept called **countability**.

An infinite set is said to be **countable** if it has a bijection with the set of natural numbers, $\mathbb{N} = \{1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}$.

As an example, consider the set of even natural numbers $\mathbb{E} = \{2, 4, 6, 8, ...\}$. At first glance, it might seem that $\mathbb{E}$ is "half the size" of $\mathbb{N}$, but we can create a bijection $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{E}$ by defining $f(n)=2n$. Every natural number gets paired with exactly one even number, demonstrating that the two sets have the same cardinality, despite both being infinite.

### Uncountability

There exist infinite sets that are **uncountable**, meaning there's no way to create a bijection between them and the natural numbers. These sets have a larger cardinality than countable sets. The most common example of an uncountable set is the set of real numbers between 0 and 1, denoted as $(0, 1)$.

To prove that this set is uncountable, we use **Cantor's Diagonal Argument**. Suppose, for contradiction, that all real numbers in $(0, 1)$ could be listed in a sequence. Each number would be written as a decimal such as 0.123456... Then, construct a new number by taking the first decimal place from the first number, the second from the second number, etc., and adding 1 to each (mod 10) (see [Review of Modular Arithmetic](#12-review-of-modular-arithmetic)). This new number clearly differs from every number in our list, contradicting our assumption that all such numbers could be listed.

| Position | Number in Sequence | Diagonal Digit | Digit After Addition (mod 10) |
| -------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1        | 0.**7**34592...    | 7              | 8                             |
| 2        | 0.5**8**0612...    | 8              | 9                             |
| 3        | 0.67**1**423...    | 1              | 2                             |
| 4        | 0.905**3**56...    | 3              | 4                             |
| 5        | 0.2809**4**7...    | 4              | 5                             |
| ...      | ...                | ...            | ...                           |
| n        | 0.xyz...**d**...   | d              | d+1 (mod 10)                  |

Here we see that no matter how many real numbers between 0 and 1 we list ("Number in Sequence" column), we can construct a new real number between 0 and 1 that is not on the list (in this case, 0.89245...). Therefore there is no bijection between $\mathbb{N}$ and $(0, 1)$, meaning the two sets have different cardinality. And since $\mathbb{N} \subseteq (0, 1)$, $(0, 1)$ has strictly greater cardinality than $\mathbb{N}$.

We can take this even further and show that $(0, 1)$ has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{R}$ via the bijection $f(x) = \tan(\pi(x - \frac{1}{2}))$. This works because the tangent function maps the interval $(\frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$ bijectively onto $\mathbb{R}$, and the expression $\pi(x - \frac{1}{2})$ maps the interval $(0, 1)$ onto $(\frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$.

### Cantor's Theorem

Cantor's Theorem is another fundamental result in the theory of cardinality. It states that for any set $A$, the set of all subsets of $A$, denoted by $\mathcal{P}(A)$, has strictly greater cardinality than $A$ itself. This holds for both finite and infinite sets.

**Proof**:

Assume for contradiction (see [Proof by Contradiction](#proof-by-contradiction-reductio-ad-absurdum)) that there exists a function $f$ from a set $A$ to its power set $\mathcal{P}(A)$ that is bijective, i.e., it is both injective (or one-to-one) and surjective (or onto). This would imply that $A$ and $\mathcal{P}(A)$ have the same cardinality.

If $f$ is surjective, then every subset of $A$ is $f(a)$ for some a in A.

Now, let's construct a subset $B$ of $A$ that contradicts the surjectivity of $f$. Define $B$ to be the set of all elements $a$ in $A$ such that $a$ is not in $f(a)$. In other words, $B = \{a \in A | a \notin f(a)\}$.

$B$ is clearly a subset of $A$, so according to our assumption, $B$ should be $f(a)$ for some $a$ in $A$. However, we have a contradiction:

If $a$ is in $B$, then by the definition of $B$, $a$ is not in $f(a)$. But if $a$ is in $B$ and $B$ is $f(a)$, then $a$ is in $f(a)$, which contradicts our assumption.
If $a$ is not in $B$, then by the definition of $B$, $a$ is in $f(a)$. But if $a$ is not in $B$ and $B$ is $f(a)$, then $a$ is not in $f(a)$, which again contradicts our assumption.
Therefore, there cannot be an element $a$ in $A$ such that $f(a) = B$, which contradicts the surjectivity of $f$. This means that no function from $A$ to $\mathcal{P}(A)$ can be bijective. Hence, the cardinality of $\mathcal{P}(A)$ must be strictly greater than the cardinality of $A$.

And this completes the proof of Cantor's Theorem.

### Practice Problems

1. Show that the set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ is countable.

2. Show that the set of all rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ (i.e., fractions of integers) is countable. (Hint: The bijection is not algebraic)

3. List some elements in $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$.

4. Using Cantor's Theorem, argue why there must exist infinitely many different sizes of infinity.

## 1.2 Review of Modular Arithmetic

Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" when they reach a certain value, the modulus. It is like an arithmetic version of a clock. One key element in modular arithmetic is the set $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, which is defined as $\{0, 1, 2, ..., n - 1\}$. The arithmetic operations we perform on $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ are known as _modular arithmetic_, _clock arithmetic_, or _arithmetic modulo_ $n$.

Formally, given two integers $a$ and $b$, we say that $a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $n$ if $n$ divides the difference between $a$ and $b$. This is written as

$$a \equiv b \pmod{n}$$

For example, if $a = 17$ and $n = 5$, then $a$ is equivalent to $2$ modulo $5$ because $5$ divides $17 - 2$, and we write $17 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$.

### Operations on $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$

Operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication can be performed in $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ as usual, but the result is taken modulo $n$.

Given $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}_{n}$, the addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations are defined as follows:

- Addition: $(a + b) \pmod{n}$
- Subtraction: $(a - b) \pmod{n}$
- Multiplication: $(a \cdot b) \pmod{n}$

For example, in $\mathbb{Z}_{7}$:

- $5 + 4$ is $2$ because $9$ modulo $7$ is $2$.
- $2 - 5$ is $4$ because $-3$ modulo $7$ is $4$.
- $3 \cdot 4$ is $5$ because $12$ modulo $7$ is $5$.

However, division in the modular arithmetic sense is a bit more complex than other operations because it does not always exist. The notion of division is replaced by the concept of the "multiplicative inverse" in modular arithmetic. Given an integer $a$ and a modulus $n$, we say that another integer $b$ is the multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $n$ if their product is congruent to $1$ modulo $n$, i.e.,

$$ab \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$$

If such a $b$ exists, we could think of it as "$a$ divided by $b$" in the modular arithmetic sense.

However, not all integers have multiplicative inverses modulo $n$. An integer $a$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $n$ if and only if $a$ and $n$ are coprime, i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1. For instance, in $\mathbb{Z}_7$, every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse: the inverse of 3 is 5, since $3 \cdot 5 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$.

### Residue Classes

A residue class is a set of integers that all leave the same remainder when divided by the modulus. Given a modulus $n$, every integer belongs to exactly one of the $n$ different residue classes modulo $n$.

Formally, the residue class of an integer $a$ modulo $n$ is the set

$$[a]_n = \{a + kn | k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$$

So for a given modulus $n$, there are $n$ residue classes. If our modulus is $4$, for example, the residue classes are $[0]_4$, $[1]_4$, $[2]_4$, and $[3]_4$.

#### Example:

Given a modulus $n = 4$, the residue class $[0]_4$ includes all integers which leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 4:

$$[0]_4 = \{…, -8, -4, 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, …\}$$

All numbers in this set, when divided by 4, yield a remainder of 0.

#### Example:

Continuing with the modulus $n = 4$, let's consider the residue class $[1]_4$. This class includes all integers which leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4:

$$[1]_4 = \{…, -7, -3, 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, …\}$$

#### Example:

Next let's use a different modulus. For example, $n = 5$. If we want to determine the residue class $[3]_5$, we'd be looking at all integers which leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5:

$$[3]_5 = \{…, -7, -2, 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, …\}$$

#### Example:

Consider $n = 7$ and the residue class $[6]_7$, which represents all integers which leave a remainder of 6 when divided by 7:

$$[6]_7 = \{…, -8, -1, 6, 13, 20, 27, …\}$$

In each of these examples, every integer number falls into exactly one of the $n$ residue classes, and each residue class represents a unique remainder that can result from dividing by $n$.

### Practice Problems

1. Perform the following operations in $\mathbb{Z}_{10}$:

   - (a) $7 + 6$
   - (b) $8 - 9$
   - (c) $6 \cdot 7$

2. Check whether the following statements are true or false:

   - (a) $14 \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$
   - (b) $27 \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$
   - (c) $35 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$

3. Find all $x \in \mathbb{Z}_{7}$ such that $2x = 1$.

4. Determine the residue class of 17 modulo 5.

## 1.3 Introduction to Mathematical Proofs

## Propositional Logic

Propositional logic, also known as propositional calculus or Boolean logic, is a branch of logic that studies how propositions can be combined and related through logical operators to form more complex propositions that can be analyzed for their truth values.

### Propositions

In propositional logic, the basic units are propositions: statements that can either be true or false, but not both. We use letters to represent these propositions. For example,

- $p$: It is raining.
- $q$: The ground is wet.

### Logical Connectives

Logical connectives are used to connect propositions:

1. **AND ($\land$)**: The proposition $p \land q$ is true if both $p$ and $q$ are true. For example the proposition $p \land q$ can be interpreted as "It is raining and the ground is wet." This proposition is true only when it is both raining and the ground is wet.
2. **OR ($\lor$)**: The proposition $p \lor q$ is true if $p$ or $q$ (or both) are true. For example the proposition $p \lor q$ can be interpreted as "It is raining or the ground is wet." This proposition is true if it is either raining, or the ground is wet, or both.
3. **NOT ($\neg$)**: The proposition $\neg p$ is true if $p$ is not true. For example the proposition $\neg p$ can be interpreted as "It is not raining." This proposition is true only when it is not raining.
4. **IMPLIES ($\implies$)**: The proposition $p \implies q$ is true unless $p$ is true and $q$ is false. For example the proposition $p \implies q$ can be interpreted as "If it is raining, then the ground is wet." This proposition is true except for the case when it is raining and the ground is not wet.
5. **IF AND ONLY IF ($\iff$)**: The proposition $p \iff q$ is true if $p$ and $q$ are both true or both false. For example the proposition $p \iff q$ can be interpreted as "It is raining if and only if the ground is wet." This proposition is true when both it is raining and the ground is wet, or when it is neither raining nor the ground is wet.

### Truth Tables

Truth tables are used to determine the truth value of a proposition based on the truth values of its components. Here are the truth tables for the basic logical connectives:

**AND ($\land$)**:

| $p$   | $q$   | $p \land q$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| true  | true  | true        |
| true  | false | false       |
| false | true  | false       |
| false | false | false       |

**OR ($\lor$)**:

| $p$   | $q$   | $p \lor q$ |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| true  | true  | true       |
| true  | false | true       |
| false | true  | true       |
| false | false | false      |

**NOT ($\neg$)**:

| $p$   | $\neg p$ |
| ----- | -------- |
| true  | false    |
| false | true     |

**IMPLIES ($\implies$)**:

| $p$   | $q$   | $p \implies q$ |
| ----- | ----- | -------------- |
| true  | true  | true           |
| true  | false | false          |
| false | true  | true           |
| false | false | true           |

**IF AND ONLY IF ($\iff$)**:

| $p$   | $q$   | $p \iff q$ |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| true  | true  | true       |
| true  | false | false      |
| false | true  | false      |
| false | false | true       |

These tables show all possible truth values of the combined propositions based on all possible truth values of $p$ and $q$.

### Evaluating Complex Propositions

A complex proposition is one that contains more than one simple proposition, combined using logical connectives.

Evaluating a complex proposition involves breaking it down into its components, assessing the truth values of these components, and combining these truth values according to the logical connectives in the proposition.

Here's how to do it, step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Components

First, identify the simple propositions in your complex proposition. For example, in the complex proposition $(p \lor q) \land \neg(r \lor s)$, the simple propositions here are $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$.

### Step 2: Assign Truth Values

For the sake of this example, let's say that $p$ is true, $q$ is false, $r$ is false, and $s$ is true.

### Step 3: Apply the Logical Connectives

We now apply the logical connectives, taking into account the precedence rules:

1. First, we need to evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses: $p \lor q$ and $r \lor s$.
   - $p \lor q$ is "true OR false", which is true.
   - $r \lor s$ is "false OR true", which is also true.
2. So our proposition becomes: $True \land \neg True$.
3. The NOT operator is next in precedence. We have to negate the second true, so the expression becomes: $True \land False$.
4. Finally, we apply the AND operator. $True \land False$ is false.

So when $p$ is true, $q$ is false, $r$ is false, and $s$ is true, the proposition $(p \lor q) \land \neg(r \lor s)$ evaluates to false.

If we follow these steps to evaluate $(p \lor q) \land \neg(r \lor s)$ for every possible way to assign truth values to $p$, $q$, $r$, and $s$, we get the following truth table:

| p   | q   | r   | s   | $p \lor q$ | $r \lor s$ | $\neg(r \lor s)$ | $(p \lor q) \land \neg(r \lor s)$ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| T   | T   | T   | T   | T          | T          | F                | F                                 |
| T   | T   | T   | F   | T          | T          | F                | F                                 |
| T   | T   | F   | T   | T          | T          | F                | F                                 |
| T   | T   | F   | F   | T          | F          | T                | T                                 |
| T   | F   | T   | T   | T          | T          | F                | F                                 |
| T   | F   | T   | F   | T          | T          | F                | F                                 |
| T   | F   | F   | T   | T          | T          | F                | F                                 |
| T   | F   | F   | F   | T          | F          | T                | T                                 |

| F   | T   | T   | F   | T          | T          | F                | F                                 |
| F   | T   | F   | T   | T          | T          | F                | F                                 |
| F   | T   | F   | F   | T          | F          | T                | T                                 |
| F   | F   | T   | T   | F          | T          | F                | F                                 |
| F   | F   | T   | F   | F          | T          | F                | F                                 |
| F   | F   | F   | T   | F          | T          | F                | F                                 |
| F   | F   | F   | F   | F          | F          | T                | F                                 |

### Laws of Propositional Logic

There are many useful laws in propositional logic that allow us to manipulate and simplify propositions. Here are some important ones:

1. **Identity laws**: $p \land True \equiv p$ and $p \lor False \equiv p$
2. **Domination laws**: $p \land False \equiv False$ and $p \lor True \equiv True$
3. **Idempotent laws**: $p \land p \equiv p$ and $p \lor p \equiv p$
4. **Double Negation law**: $\neg (\neg p) \equiv p$
5. **Commutative laws**: $p \land q \equiv q \land p$ and $p \lor q \equiv q \lor p$
6. **Associative laws**: $(p \land q) \land r \equiv p \land (q \land r)$ and $(p \lor q) \lor r \equiv p \lor (q \lor r)$
7. **Distributive laws**: $p \land (q \lor r) \equiv (p \land q) \lor (p \land r)$ and $p \lor (q \land r) \equiv (p \lor q) \land (p \lor r)$
8. **DeMorgan's laws**: $\neg (p \land q) \equiv \neg p \lor \neg q$ and $\neg (p \lor q) \equiv \neg p \land \neg q$
9. **Absorption laws**: $p \lor (p \land q) \equiv p$ and $p \land (p \lor q) \equiv p$
10. **Negation laws**: $p \lor \neg p \equiv True$ and $p \land \neg p \equiv False$
11. **Implication law**: $p \implies q \equiv \neg p \lor q$
12. **Equivalence law**: $p \iff q \equiv (p \implies q) \land (q \implies p)$

### Practice Problems

Now that we have covered the basics of propositional logic, let's work on some practice problems:

1. Simplify the following logical expressions using the laws of propositional logic:

   - $\neg (p \lor True)$
   - $(p \land q) \lor (\neg p \land q)$
   - $\neg ((\neg p \land q) \lor (p \land \neg q))$

2. Construct the truth table for the proposition $p \land (\lnot q \lor p)$.

3. Show the impliction law is true by writing out its truth table.

## Predicate Logic

While propositional logic deals with simple declarative statements and their combinations, predicate logic, also known as **first-order logic**, provides a more detailed structure that allows us to express more complex forms of reasoning. The key components of predicate logic include _quantifiers_ and _predicates_.

### Predicates

A **predicate** is a statement about some object or objects. For instance, "is blue", "are tall", or "has wings" are predicates. Predicates become propositions when we fill in the objects. In propositional logic, we could say "$S$ is true", but in predicate logic, we'd say something like "$P(x)$ is true", where $x$ is a particular object, and $P$ is a predicate.

For instance, let's consider the predicate "$P(x)$ is a student". If we fill in the object $x$ with "John", we have a proposition "$P(\text{John})$ is a student", which can be true or false.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers are used to specify the quantity of instances for which the predicate holds true. The two primary types of quantifiers in predicate logic are:

- Universal quantifier ($\forall$): This denotes "for all". If we say $\forall x P(x)$, we mean that the predicate $P$ holds for all instances of $x$.

  For instance, if our universe of discourse (the set that $x$ can come from) is the set of all students in a school and $P(x)$ is "$x$ is a student", then $\forall x P(x)$ means "Every person in the school is a student".

- Existential quantifier ($\exists$): This denotes "there exists". If we say $\exists x P(x)$, we mean that there exists at least one instance of $x$ for which the predicate $P$ holds.

  Continuing the previous example, if $P(x)$ is "$x$ is a student", then $\exists x P(x)$ means "There exists a person in the school who is a student".

### Formal Notations

Formally, predicates and quantifiers are combined to form logical statements. Let's see how we can represent some common statements using predicate logic.

- "All men are mortal."

  If $M(x)$ denotes "$x$ is a man" and $N(x)$ denotes "$x$ is mortal", we can express this as: $\forall x (M(x) \implies N(x))$.

- "Some birds can fly."

  If $B(x)$ denotes "$x$ is a bird" and $F(x)$ denotes "$x$ can fly", we can express this as: $\exists x (B(x) \land F(x))$.

### Practice Problems

Now that you have learned about predicates and quantifiers, let's put your knowledge to the test with some practice problems.

1. Translate the following English sentences into predicate logic.

   a. All dogs bark.

   b. There exists a cat that does not meow.

   c. No student is perfect.

2. Translate the following predicate logic statements into English, assuming $G(x)$ is "$x$ is a genius", $T(x)$ is "$x$ is a teacher", and $S(x)$ is "$x$ is a student".

   a. $\exists x (G(x) \land T(x))$

   b. $\forall x (S(x) \implies \neg G(x))$

## Proof Techniques

Fundamentally, mathematics is about using logic and reasoning to deduce new truths. And the way to learn and deduce mathematical truths is through the rigorous practice of writing proofs.

### Direct Proof ($p \implies q$)

In a direct proof, we prove that $p \implies q$ is true by assuming $p$ to be true, and consequently showing that $q$ must also be true.

**Example:** For all integers $a$ and $b$, if $a$ and $b$ are even, then $a+b$ is even.

**Proof:**

Given two integers, $a$ and $b$, we assume that they are both even. By the definition of an even number, we can express $a$ and $b$ as follows:

- $a = 2m$ for some integer $m$
- $b = 2n$ for some integer $n$

We add $a$ and $b$:

$$a + b = 2m + 2n = 2(m + n)$$

$m + n$ is an integer because the sum of integers is an integer. Therefore, $a+b$ is of the form of an even number. Hence, we have proved that the sum of two even numbers is always even.

### Non-Constructive Proof

A non-constructive proof establishes the existence of a mathematical object without necessarily providing a way to construct such an object.

**Example:** There exists irrational numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^b$ is rational.

**Proof:** Consider the irrational number $\sqrt{2}$. If we take $a = b = \sqrt{2}$, then $a^b = (\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}}$. We don't know whether this is rational or irrational. If it's rational, we're done. If it's irrational, then let $a = (\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}}$ and $b = \sqrt{2}$. Then, $a^b = ((\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}})^{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^2 = 2$ which is rational.

### Proof by Contradiction

In a proof by contradiction, we assume the negation of the proposition to be proven and show that this leads to a contradiction.

**Example:** $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.

**Proof:** Assume for contradiction that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then it can be expressed as a ratio of two integers $a$ and $b$ (with $b \neq 0$) in simplest form, i.e., $\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$. Squaring both sides, we get $2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}$ or $a^2 = 2b^2$. This implies that $a^2$ is even, and hence $a$ is even. But if $a$ is even, then $a^2$ is divisible by $4$, so $2b^2$ is divisible by $4$, which means $b^2$ is even, and hence $b$ is also even. But this contradicts the assumption that $a$ and $b$ are in simplest form, since they have a common factor of $2$. Therefore, our initial assumption that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational must be false.

### Proof by Contrapositive ($\neg q \implies \neg p$)

In a proof by contrapositive, we prove a statement of the form "If $p$, then $q$" by proving the equivalent statement "If not $q$, then not $p$".

**Example:** If $n^2$ is odd, then $n$ must be odd.

**Proof:** We'll prove the contrapositive: If $n$ is not odd (i.e., is even), then $n^2$ is not odd (i.e., is even). If $n$ is an even number, then by definition, it can be expressed as $n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Therefore, $n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)$, which is twice an integer and hence is even.

### Weak Induction

Weak induction, also known as the Principle of Mathematical Induction, is a mathematical proof technique primarily used to validate a sequence of statements $P(n)$, where each statement is associated with a natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The technique consists of two steps:

1. The Base Case: We verify that the statement $P(1)$ is true.

2. The Inductive Step: We assume that the statement $P(k)$ is true for some arbitrary $k \in \mathbb{N}$ (Inductive Hypothesis), and then we prove that $P(k+1)$ is also true under this assumption.

Through this process, we can infer that the statement $P(n)$ is true for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

**Example:** The equation $1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is true for every natural number n.

**Proof:**

**Starting Point ($n=1$):** If you add up all the natural numbers up to $1$, you get $1$. If you calculate $\frac{1(1+1)}{2}$, you also get $1$. This means our equation holds true when $n=1$.

**Induction Step:** We begin by assuming our equation holds true for $n=k$ (this is called the Inductive Hypothesis). We then need to show that it's also true when $n=k+1$.

By applying our assumption, we can say that $1 + 2 + \ldots + k + (k+1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1)$.

Simplifying the right-hand side of this equation, we get $\frac{k^2+k+2k+2}{2}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}$. So we've demonstrated that if our equation is true for $n=k$, it's also true for $n=k+1$. This validates our claim through weak induction.

### Strong Induction

Strong induction, also known as the Principle of Complete Induction, extends the principle of weak induction. It too is used to verify a sequence of statements $P(n)$, where each statement is connected to a natural number $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The strong induction process also has two parts:

1. The Base Case: We confirm the statement $P(1)$ is true.

2. The Inductive Step: We assume that the statement $P(i)$ is true for all $i$ in the range $1 \leq i \leq k$ for some arbitrary $k \in \mathbb{N}$ (Inductive Hypothesis), and then we prove that $P(k+1)$ is true based on this assumption.

This allows us to establish the validity of the statement $P(n)$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A key difference is that strong induction permits the inductive step to rely on all previous cases, rather than just the immediately preceding case as in weak induction.

**Example:** Any amount of postage of 12 cents or more can be created using only 4-cent and 5-cent stamps.

**Proof:**

**Starting Points (n=12,13,14,15):** We can make 12 cents with three 4-cent stamps, 13 cents with two 4-cent stamps and one 5-cent stamp, 14 cents with one 4-cent stamp and two 5-cent stamps, and 15 cents with three 5-cent stamps.

**Inductive Step:** Let's assume that for any amount k (where $12 \leq k < n$ for $n$ outside our starting points), we can create the total using 4-cent and 5-cent stamps. Now we need to show that we can create the total of $n$ cents. We can express $n$ as $(n-4) + 4$. And since $n$ is at least $16$, $(n-4)$ is at least $12$. From our inductive hypothesis, we know we can form $(n-4)$ cents. Thus, we can create $n$ cents by just adding one more 4-cent stamp to the stamps that form $(n-4)$ cents. This proves our claim using strong induction.

### Proving Bi-conditional Statements ($p \iff q$)

Bi-conditional or "if and only if" (IFF) statements are compound logical statements which assert that two propositions, $p$ and $q$, are equivalent, i.e., $p$ is true if and only if $q$ is true. The statement is denoted as $p \iff q$.

To prove a bi-conditional statement, you typically need to prove two separate implications: $p \implies q$ (if $p$ then $q$) and $q \implies p$ (if $q$ then $p$). This is often called proving the statement in both directions.

### Steps:

1. **Prove $p \implies q$ (Forward direction)**: Assume that $p$ is true and use this assumption to show that $q$ must also be true.

2. **Prove $q \implies p$ (Backward direction)**: Assume that $q$ is true and use this assumption to show that $p$ must also be true.

Once you have proven both these directions, you have successfully shown that $p \iff q$.

**Example:** Show an integer $n$ is even if and only if $n^2$ is even.

To prove this, we'll show two things: $p \implies q$ (if $n$ is even then $n^2$ is even) and $q \implies p$ (if $n^2$ is even then $n$ is even).

**Proof of $p \implies q$ (Forward direction)**:

Let's assume $p$ is true, i.e., $n$ is even. By definition, an even number can be written as $2k$, where $k$ is an integer. So, we write $n$ as $2k$.

$$
n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)
$$

Since $2k^2$ is an integer (since the product of integers is an integer), $n^2$ can be written in the form $2m$, where $m$ is an integer ($2k^2$ in this case). Thus, $n^2$ is even.

**Proof of $q \implies p$ (Backward direction)**:

Let's assume $q$ is true, i.e., $n^2$ is even. This means $n^2$ can be written as $2m$ for some integer $m$.

From this, we can't directly show that $n$ is even, so we proceed by contrapositive, i.e., instead of showing $q \implies p$, we'll show $\neg p \implies \neg q$ (if $n$ is not even then $n^2$ is not even), which is logically equivalent.

So, assume that $n$ is not even, i.e., $n$ is odd. Then by definition, $n$ can be written as $2k+1$ for some integer $k$. Then $n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$, which is of the form $2m + 1$ and thus odd (not even).

This shows that if $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even.

So, we've proven both $p \implies q$ and $q \implies p$. Therefore, $n$ is even if and only if $n^2$ is even.
